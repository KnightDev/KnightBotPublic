# KnightBot - Security and Moderation

KnightBot is a Security and Moderation-focused Discord Bot built to keep your server safe without the need for subscriptions, premium bot plans, or having multiple bots to cover bypasses for one another. 

KnightBot is coded in **Python** using the *discord.py* library, and may work and feel different than most Discord bots. 

# Help Information

KnightBot's help is divided into 5 categories:

- Information
- Security
- Moderation
- Music
- General

**Information**

The information category contains commands that allow you to retrieve information about the target server or user. Examples are commands such as:

- serverinfo
- userinfo
- ping
- termsofservice
- info

...And so forth. 

**Security**

The security category contains commands that allow you to enable, disable, and configure features of KnightBot that help increase server and user safety. Examples are commands such as:

- antiinvite
- antilink
- antisocial
- antiraid

As well as commands for configuring and interactng with the KnightBot Security Checkpoint.

...And so forth. (see the pattern here?)
