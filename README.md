# KnightBot - Security and Moderation

**STOP** - Needing assistance with KnightBot for features or errors that are not documented in this repository? Join the support Discord @ http://discord.gg/FARHDTv, solve Checkpoint, and ping a Support staff member with your question, comment, concern, or error. 

**NEED TO REPORT A BUG?** - Please DM KnightBot with the command **+bugreport** followed by the error, or run the command in any server KnightBot is in where the error is prevalent. 


KnightBot is a Security and Moderation-focused Discord Bot built to keep your server safe without the need for subscriptions, premium bot plans, or having multiple bots to cover bypasses for one another. 

KnightBot is coded in **Python** using the *discord.py* library, and may work and feel different than most Discord bots. 

# Help Information

KnightBot's help is divided into 5 categories:

- Information
- Security
- Moderation
- Music
- General

**Information**

The information category contains commands that allow you to retrieve information about the target server or user. Examples are commands such as:

- serverinfo
- userinfo
- ping
- termsofservice
- info

...And so forth. 

**Security**

The security category contains commands that allow you to enable, disable, and configure features of KnightBot that help increase server and user safety. Examples are commands such as:

- antiinvite
- antilink
- antisocial
- antiraid

As well as commands for configuring and interactng with the KnightBot Security Checkpoint.

...And so forth. (see the pattern here?)

**Moderation**

The moderation category contains all commands for performing moderative actions via KnightBot, or configuring applicable AutoModerative features. Examples are commands such as:

- warn/warnset
- ban
- mute
- kick
- giverole/takerole

and many others. 

**Music**

KnightBot may be primarily for Security and Moderation, but its Music functionality is by no means bare. KnightBot allows for extremely high-quality music playback from both YouTube and SoundCloud as well as per-server playlists, vote skipping, all of that good stuff. Few commands to know about:

- play (you can either type a song name and artist or include a YouTube or SoundCloud link)
- pause
- resume
- skip
- song (to check current song)
- queue (to check what's up next)

And a few more. 

**General**

The general category contains commands that I really couldn't sort under any of the others. These are commands for say, marking yourself as AFK, checking the time and weather in different places, things like that. These are extras of the bot and are not core to its Security and Moderation functionality.
